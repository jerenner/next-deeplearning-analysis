# Deep Learning in NEXT

[NEXT](http://next.ific.uv.es/next) ("**N**eutrino **E**xperiment with a **X**enon **T**PC") is a physics experiment based in the [Laboratorio Subterr&aacute;neo de Canfranc](http://www.lsc-canfranc.es/en) (Canfranc Underground Laboratory) in Canfranc, Spain.  It is a particle detector (a TPC: "Time Projection Chamber") filled with xenon gas at high pressure (10-15 times atmospheric pressure) that will be used to search for the rare nuclear decay [neutrinoless double-beta ($$0\nu\beta \beta$$) decay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_beta_decay).

Here we briefly describe the data analysis that must be performed in the NEXT experiment, and we detail methods based on deep learning techniques that can be applied to the different stages of this analysis.
